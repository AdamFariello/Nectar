# Download 32 bit zip of TomCat9 server https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
# Extract the zip and in command prompt (open as administrator) navigate to the bin folder of the extracted file
# type and run the command "service install" to install the service
# start the server with startup.bat which will open another console for the server 
# To see if it works in a browser go to http://localhost:8080/ which should show a page with apache tomcat as the heading
